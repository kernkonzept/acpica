 *              Context             - Passed into AcpiNsWalkNamespace
 *
 * DESCRIPTION: This routine checks to see if the object is a Region if it
 *              is then the address handler is installed in it.
 *
 *              If the Object is a Device, and the device has a handler of
 *              the same type then the search is terminated in that branch.
 *
 *              This is because the existing handler is closer in proximity
 *              to any more regions than the one we are trying to install.
