 * FUNCTION:    AcpiAmlStoreObjectToObject
 *
 * PARAMETERS:  *ValDesc            - Value to be stored
 *              *DestDesc           - Object to receive the value
 *              
 * RETURN:      Status
 *
 * DESCRIPTION: Store an object to another object.
 *
 *              The Assignment of an object to another (not named) object 
 *              is handled here.
 *              The val passed in will replace the current value (if any)
 *              with the input value.
 *
 *              When storing into an object the data is converted to the
 *              target object type then stored in the object.  This means
 *              that the target object type (for an initialized target) will
 *              not be changed by a store operation.
 *
 *              This module allows destination types of Number, String,
 *              and Buffer.
