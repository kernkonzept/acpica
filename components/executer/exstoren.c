 * FUNCTION:    AcpiAmlStoreObjectToNode
 *
 * PARAMETERS:  *ValDesc            - Value to be stored
 *              *Node           - Named object to recieve the value
 *
 * RETURN:      Status
 *
 * DESCRIPTION: Store the object to the named object.
 *
 *              The Assignment of an object to a named object is handled here
 *              The val passed in will replace the current value (if any)
 *              with the input value.
 *
 *              When storing into an object the data is converted to the
 *              target object type then stored in the object.  This means
 *              that the target object type (for an initialized target) will
 *              not be changed by a store operation.
 *
 *              NOTE: the global lock is acquired early.  This will result
 *              in the global lock being held a bit longer.  Also, if the
 *              function fails during set up we may get the lock when we
 *              don't really need it.  I don't think we care.
